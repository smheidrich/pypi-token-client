Installation
============

Via pip
-------

To install from PyPI:

.. code:: bash

  pip3 install pypi-token-client

You'll also have to install the required Playwright browsers (currently just
Chromium):

.. code:: bash

   playwright install chromium

Source code
-----------

The source repository can be found
`on GitLab <https://gitlab.com/smheidrich/pypi-token-client/>`_.
There is also a `GitHub mirror <https://github.com/smheidrich/pypi-token-client>`_,
but I much prefer GitLab so all development happens there.
